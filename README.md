Set up Firebase:

Create a Firebase project on the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Set up Firestore Realtime Database and configure Firebase in your project.
Update the Firebase configuration in your code (usually in a Firebase configuration file) with your project's credentials.
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will launch the application in development mode, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Firebase Configuration
You will need to set up Firebase in your project by configuring it with your Firebase project credentials. This typically involves creating a Firebase configuration file with the necessary Firebase settings. Here's an example of what the configuration might look like:

javascript
// src/firebase/config.ts

import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
  messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
};

const firebaseApp = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(firebaseApp);

export { db };
Replace the placeholders (YOUR_API_KEY, YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN, etc.) with your actual Firebase project credentials.
